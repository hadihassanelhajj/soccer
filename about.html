<p>Soccer is an association game where a team of 11 players each play against each other. The sport is played with a spherical ball. Approximately 250 million people play the sport in over 200 countries, which makes it the worldâ€™s most popular sport.</p>

<p>Soccer is called football around the world, except in the US, Canada and few other countries where the word football was already taken by another sport. Soccer is distinguished from rugby and American/Canadian football in that it is primarily played with the feet. Touching the ball with hands is not allowed.</p>
